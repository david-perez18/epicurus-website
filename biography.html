  <h1>Biography of Epicurus</h1>
  <img src="images/epicurus.jpg" alt="Epicurus portrait">

  <p>Epicurus (341–271 BCE) was born on the island of Samos, located in the Mediterranean Sea, a Greek settlement under Athenian rule. He is considered one of the most influential philosophers of the Hellenistic period and the founder of Epicureanism, a highly impactful school of philosophy.</p>

  <p>When the Athenians were expelled from Samos, Epicurus was forced to leave and join his father in Colophon. Here, he studied philosophy under Nausiphanes, who followed the teachings of Democritus and introduced him to atomism, the idea that the physical universe is composed of fundamental, indivisible components known as atoms flying through empty space.</p>

  <p>His work revised the atomism of Democritus and rejected the existence of Platonic forms and an immaterial soul, as well as the teleology of Aristotle. Epicurus tried to explain all natural phenomena in atomic terms, which was the basis of his teachings.</p>

  <p>After returning to Athens, he founded his own school, “The Garden,” during a time when other major schools like Plato’s Academy and Aristotle’s Lyceum were also active. David Konstan, in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, explains that it became the heart of Epicurean philosophy, where Epicurus taught until his death.</p>

  <p>Unlike the Pythagorean school, members of the Garden were not required to give up their property, which meant economic inequality was part of the community’s structure. William Wallace (1843–1897), a noted philosopher and scholar, in his work <em>Epicureanism</em>, reports the following, “Some of his followers had suggested that they should throw all their property into a common fund; but Epicurus rejected the suggestion of communism as savouring of distrust and as laying a restraint on freewill offerings.”</p>

  <p>Additionally, Epicurus welcomed students from all social classes, including women and slaves. The same work by Wallace indicates this inclusive approach, noting that “His emancipation of the slaves may be paralleled by similar acts in the testaments of Theophrastus, Strato, and Lyco, the three successive heads of the Aristotelian school.” Slaves were not only present in the Garden, but also treated with a degree of respect uncommon at the time. Epicurus remained celibate and often recommended celibacy to others, though it was not a prerequisite of the school.</p>

  <p>Rival philosophical schools frequently disparaged the Garden and Epicureanism, spreading false claims that it promoted indulgent pleasure-seeking. Despite the criticism, Epicureanism grew in popularity, with several hundred Epicurean schools eventually set up throughout Asia Minor.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, most of Epicurus’ work hasn’t survived; Tim O’Keefe, in the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, reports that this is believed to be due to his ungodly ideas, which may have enraged religious authorities. The book <em>Lives of the Philosophers</em> by Diogenes Laertius recounts Epicurus’ life and teachings through three of his letters, summarizing major areas of his philosophy.</p>

  <p>The Letter to Herodotus serves as a concise summary of Epicurus’ natural philosophy. In this letter, he explained his materialist worldview, arguing that things cannot arise from nothing and that all phenomena must be explained through natural causes rather than divine intervention.</p>

  <p>He emphasizes that understanding the atomic nature leads to freedom from fear, a significant principle of his philosophy. He believed God existed but had no influence on human affairs, challenging dominant religious views, which possibly fueled opposition to his work.</p>

  <p>Overall, the letter serves as a practical guide to understanding nature through atomism, freeing people from unnecessary fears by rejecting superstition and emphasizing rational thought, ultimately promoting a fulfilling life.</p>
